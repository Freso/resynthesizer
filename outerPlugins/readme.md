Dir contains outer plugins.

Outer plugins copy or massage an image and call the engine plugin.

Two implementations:
python (GimpFu)
scheme (ScriptFu)

The Python for Gimp v3 uses GIR and is vastly incompatible with v2 GimpFu.
While ScriptFu plugins for v2 are more (but not completely) compatible with Gimp v3.
